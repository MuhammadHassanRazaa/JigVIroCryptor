Privacy is one of the topmost problems in the world. Messages and Communications
between people should be protected. Privacy is everyone’s basic right. As most the
messages are shared and communications are done electronically via emails, social media
messengers, and other communication platforms on World Wide Web. These sources are
not well secured or securities have loopholes and messages can be intercepted by other
people who can use message against others. The problem is solved by encrypting
messages and turning them into the bunch of random characters which are meaningless and
can never be understood without decrypting them back to the original message.

P.S. Its an old project when we have started learning programming, so we juts used IF ELSE. NVM :)
